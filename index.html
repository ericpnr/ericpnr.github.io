I develop and estimator which explicitly accounts for the role that memory and cognitive heuristics have on evaluative tasks. In particular, incorporate the "Evaluation by Moments" hypothesis which supposes that a judge assigns a judgment to a
sequence of actions relative to a mental representation that the judge has constructed.

I simulate a network of suppliers and distributors over time where distributors must resupply periodically under stochastic inelastic demand conditions with terminals who also have to resupply under stochastic supply shortages.

          Developing Statistical Tools to Address the Unique Challenges of Big Data
        </div>
        <div class=indt_1>
          Model selection, overfitting, reproducibility, extremely wide data sets,
          privacy, and computational speed are but a few of the concerns that
          Economists, Social Scientists, Analysts, and Data Scientists must attend
          to as they attempt to gain insights from the flood of information
          generated daily. My research is focused on developing statistical tools
          to help researchers confront these issues and choose the best techniques
          to approach their research question so that their conclusions generalize
          from sample to population.

          Developing Estimators That Account for Human Cognitive Processes
        </div>
        <div class=indt_1>
          Human decision making is notoriously difficult to analyze.
          We have inherent biases, we don't pay as much attention as we should,
          our memories are neither fixed nor as good as was previously thought,
          and we use heuristics far more than we would like to admit.
          In order to accurately analyze the decisions that consumers, producers,
          performers, and judges make one must depart from the simplifying
          assumption of total rationality, and model decision making as it
          actually happens.   I endeavor to incorporate the ever advancing
          understanding of these processes from psychology and neuroscience into
          robust estimation techniques.

          Capital Investment Under Uncertainty, Product Switching, and Congestion Constraints
        </div>
        <div class=indt_1>
          How do companies determine the correct mixture of capital investment
          types in order to prevent customer product switching in the face of
          uncertain market conditions? For firms, there is always uncertainty
          about what elements of their current business will ultimately cost
          them customers  and how to invest capital to prevent this. For example
          developers of an online multiplayer game may have to choose between
          fixing a software bug and renting server space while accounting for
          uncertain network congestion. Often, in order to incorporate the full
          complexity of market conditions these questions must be answered
          computationally.  I simulate the operation of such markets.

        <div class=indt_2>
          The goal of this course is to provide students with a foundational understanding of classical statistics and how
it fits within the broader context of data science. Students will learn to apply the most common statistical
procedures correctly, checking assumptions and responding appropriately when they appear violated. They
will also learn to evaluate the design of a study and how the variables being measured relate to research
questions.
The course begins with a focus on exploratory analysis and descriptive statistics. From there, we learn
how statistical models are built using the structure of probability theory. Next, we use the simple example
of the mean to demonstrate the use of estimators and hypothesis tests. We then turn to classical linear
regression, taking several weeks to build a strong understanding of this central topic. Our treatment stresses
causal inference and includes a discussion of omitted variables. At the end, we describe some of the concerns
that arise in the process of specifying linear models. Throughout the course, students will practice analyzing
real-world data using the open-source language, R.

Economists study the process by which individuals and firms make decisions in a rational manner given their set
of circumstances. Economists are concerned with the consequences for individuals, firms, and
the economy of decisions made this way. Thus, in studying economics, reasoning skills are much
more important than memorization skills. Having to think and reason (that is, make decisions)
rather than just memorize makes economics a challenging subject for many students. On the
other hand, studying economics also develops reasoning and analytical skills.

          Information Visualization Display Using Associative Clustered Tiling and Tesselation
        </div>
        <div class=indt_1>
          The amount and specifcity of the information that each of us have access to is unprecedented. Inquiries
once requiring a lengthy trip to the library or a long wait for the next edition of the local newspaper
are now resolved in seconds and from practically anywhere our curiosity is aroused. Unfortunately, the
typical manner in which collections of information are electronically presented fails to provide us with
a sense of the interconnection between those pieces of information. The suppression of this sense of
interrelation is a hold over from the classical linearized presentation style mandated by the limitations of
producing physical media and has been adopted almost wholesale by electronic media platforms. This
sense of interconnectivity is vital as it provides us with a roadmap of how to explore a topic in search
of greater understanding. Having a roadmap is especially helpful when we, as we so often do, use a few
keywords to and an entry point into a topic and hope that the information we are truly interested in
can be found from there. Here we develop a method by which information can be electronically
presented users that provides this sense of connection and interrelatedness allowing a viewer to easily navigate
their way to a fuller understanding of a topic.
