        Hi, I am Eric Penner and welcome to my page. As evidenced by the content of this page
        I am and have been a number of things throughout my life but really I am
        just a curious guy born and raised in Colorado. I spend most of my days
        doing research in Economics and Econometrics and I spend my nights hanging
        out with my wife and newborn daughter, reading, and writing a little code here and
        there.
        When I get the chance I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, and snowboarding.

        Machine Learning Techniques to Exploit the Unique Opportunities Provided by “Big Data”
        </div>
        <div class=indt_1>
          Model selection, analyzing unstructured data, balancing exploitation and exploration in assign- ing treatments, and proxy variable generation are but a few of the issues that Economists, and Data Scientists once dreamed of having. Thanks to the rapid development of the field of ma- chine learning, tools now exist to accomplish tasks once dismissed as infeasible. My research here is focused on developing econometric tools to help researchers leverage machine learning techniques in order to construct causal inference and credible counterfactuals. My working pa- per “ Selection of Heterogenous Instruments in Fixed Effect Panel Model” is an estimator which incorporates both a lasso shrinkage estimator to provide a data driven means of selecting valid heterogenous instruments, and a sample splitting routine in manner suggested by Chernozhukov et al. (2017). The original inspiration for this estimator was to improve the estimation of log technological change in Augmented Solow-Hall type regressions like the one found in Basu et al. (2006).

          Developing Estimators That Account for Human Cognitive Processes
        </div>
        <div class=indt_1>
          Human decision making is notoriously difficult to analyze. We have inherent biases, we don’t pay as much attention as we should, our memories are neither fixed nor as good as was pre- viously thought, and we use heuristics far more than we would like to admit. In order to accurately analyze the decisions that consumers, producers, performers, and judges make one must depart from the simplifying assumption of total rationality, and model decision making as it more realistically happens. New theoretical frameworks for understanding these departures are numerous, but how can we estimate that parameters of a corresponding structural model when attributes like opinion, attention, and motivation are considered unobservable using with traditional methods. We can inform the estimation of these parameters with techniques like
sentiment analysis, computer vision, and word embeddings. My research in this area is focused on utilizing machine learning tools to inform the estimation of structural models of departures to purely rational decision making.

          Capital Investment Under Uncertainty, Product Switching, and Congestion Constraints
        </div>
        <div class=indt_1>

How do companies determine the correct mixture of capital investment types in order to pre- vent customer product switching in the face of uncertain market conditions? For firms, there is always uncertainty about what elements of their current business will ultimately cost them customers and how to invest capital to prevent this. For example developers of an online multi- player game (PUBG) may have to choose between fixing a software bug and renting server space while accounting for uncertain network congestion and competitors in the market (Fortnite). Often, in order to incorporate the full complexity of market conditions these questions must be answered computationally. I simulate the operation of such markets in order to determine a decision rule for the best mixture of capital types for a given set of market conditions. These decision rules are of independent interest to academic economists but what value can a small firm derive from them given that they can observe only a small subset of the market conditions needed for an optimal solution. My research here is focused on methods for adaptively reducing the dimension of the decision rule space to account for the information available to market firms.

          The goal of this course is to provide students with a foundational understanding of classical statistics and how
it fits within the broader context of data science. Students will learn to apply the most common statistical
procedures correctly, checking assumptions and responding appropriately when they appear violated. They
will also learn to evaluate the design of a study and how the variables being measured relate to research
questions.
The course begins with a focus on exploratory analysis and descriptive statistics. From there, we learn
how statistical models are built using the structure of probability theory. Next, we use the simple example
of the mean to demonstrate the use of estimators and hypothesis tests. We then turn to classical linear
regression, taking several weeks to build a strong understanding of this central topic. Our treatment stresses
causal inference and includes a discussion of omitted variables. At the end, we describe some of the concerns
that arise in the process of specifying linear models. Throughout the course, students will practice analyzing
real-world data using the open-source language, R. <br> <a class = "two" href='linked/unit_8_ls_inst.html'> Sample Lecture </a> ,<a class = "two" href='linked/last_first_unit_8_hw.html'> Sample Assignment </a>

Economists study the process by which individuals and firms make decisions in a rational manner given their set
of circumstances. Economists are concerned with the consequences for individuals, firms, and
the economy of decisions made this way. Thus, in studying economics, reasoning skills are much
more important than memorization skills. Having to think and reason (that is, make decisions)
rather than just memorize makes economics a challenging subject for many students. On the
other hand, studying economics also develops reasoning and analytical skills.

          The amount and specifcity of the information that each of us have access to is unprecedented. Inquiries
once requiring a lengthy trip to the library or a long wait for the next edition of the local newspaper
are now resolved in seconds and from practically anywhere our curiosity is aroused. Unfortunately, the
typical manner in which collections of information are electronically presented fails to provide us with
a sense of the interconnection between those pieces of information. The suppression of this sense of
interrelation is a hold over from the classical linearized presentation style mandated by the limitations of
producing physical media and has been adopted almost wholesale by electronic media platforms. This
sense of interconnectivity is vital as it provides us with a roadmap of how to explore a topic in search
of greater understanding. Having a roadmap is especially helpful when we, as we so often do, use a few
keywords to and an entry point into a topic and hope that the information we are truly interested in
can be found from there. Here we develop a method by which information can be electronically
presented users that provides this sense of connection and interrelatedness allowing a viewer to easily navigate
their way to a fuller understanding of a topic.
